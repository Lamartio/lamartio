### About me
Back in 2011, while studying Civil Engineering, I got the assignment to make a little mock app for
aiding the construction site. Not knowing how, but enthusiastic about what, I started learning
myself how to make Android applications. After graduating I said goodbye to my Civil Engineering
career and dove in the world of programming.

##### The great journey ðŸšš
In January 2020 I sold my house and quit my job to start a live of adventure. With no more
belongings holding me, I bought a van, remodelled it to a camper and started touring through europe.
During this time I decided to develop myself and my health and that led me to my certification of
Holistic Transformational Health Coach (in short: Holobody) and fitness trainer of the 10X method.
