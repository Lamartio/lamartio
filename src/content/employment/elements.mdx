Eager to develop my skills as a software engineer, I joined the bright minds at Elements: a digital agency that develops
next-level web applications and mobile apps. After developing Android apps, I was able to quench my thirst for technology
by developing apps for iOS+Xamarin, iOS+Swift and webGL in combination with [Simulated Reality](https://www.dimenco.eu/).

Next to developing my technical skills, I also helped to make the working place more fun by keeping tech talks, organizing hackathons and pizza + board game evenings.
