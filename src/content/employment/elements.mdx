Eager to develop my skills as a software engineer, I joined the bright minds at Elements: a digital agency that develops
next-level web applications and mobile apps. After developing some Android apps, I was able to still my thirst for technology
by developing apps for iOS+Xamarin, iOS+Swift and webGL in combination with [Simulated Reality](https://www.dimenco.eu/).

Next to developing my technical skills, I also helped to make the working place more fun by keeping tech talks, organizing hackathons and pizza + board game evenings.

- Development of (native + cross-platform) mobile apps and web apps.
- In collaboration with companies ranging from startups to multinationals. For example: Aegon, Minibrew, Powerpeers, Dimenco & AVROTROS.
- Adaptive and fearless mindset towards technology
