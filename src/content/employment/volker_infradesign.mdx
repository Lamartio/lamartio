VolkerInfra Design is an engineering company that designs large infrastructure projects. Together with a colleague, I develop innovative software to improve our construction-related activities. Examples include QR codes on construction drawings, virtual reality for highway analyses and mobile applications for the construction site. I am responsible for developing Android, iOS and Windows Phone apps.

Due to the success of our software, we are strengthened by an external team of developers with an autistic background. I lead the project through Scrum and help the team to understand the Xamarin platform.

- Cross-platform application development with Xamarin (C#).
- Native development for Android and IOS (Java and Objective C).
- Promoting and implementing innovations at VolkerWessels.
- Leading an external (Scrum-)team of developers.
- Back-end and web front-end development with Google App Engine, Google Web Toolkit en GWT-Material.
