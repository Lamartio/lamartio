                Back in 2011, while studying Civil Engineering, I got the assignment to make a little mock app for
                aiding the construction site. Not knowing how, but enthusiastic about what, I started learning
                myself how to make Android applications. After graduating I said goodbye to my Civil Engineering
                career and dove in the world of programming.

                In January 2020 I sold my house and quit my job to start a live of adventure. With no more
                belongings holding me, I bought a van, remodelled it to a camper and started touring through europe.
                During this time I decided to develop myself and my health and that led me to my certification of
                Holistic Transformational Health Coach (in short: Holobody) and fitness trainer of the 10X method.
